# Swaarm iOS SDK

A lightweight event tracking and attribution SDK for iOS. Only ~64KB including its single dependency (zlib for gzip compression).

**Requirements:** iOS 14.0+ | Swift 5.9+ | Xcode 15+

---

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager (recommended)

In Xcode: **File > Add Package Dependencies**, then enter:

```
https://github.com/swaarm/iOS-sdk
```

Or add it to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/swaarm/iOS-sdk", from: "2.1.0")
]
```

---

## Quick Start

```swift
import SwaarmSdk

// In your app's init or didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
SwaarmAnalytics.configure(
    token: "your-token",
    host: "https://your-tracker-domain.com"
)
```

That's it. The SDK automatically sends an install (or reinstall) event on first launch and an `__open` event on every launch.

---

## Configuration

```swift
SwaarmAnalytics.configure(
    token: "your-token",                          // Required - provided by Swaarm
    host: "https://your-tracker-domain.com",      // Required - provided by Swaarm
    batchSize: 50,                                // Max events per batch (default: 50)
    flushFrequency: 2,                            // Seconds between flushes (default: 2)
    maxSize: 500,                                 // Max queued events in memory (default: 500)
    debug: false,                                 // Enable debug logging (default: false)
    attributionCallback: { data in                // Called when attribution data arrives
        print("Attribution: \(data)")
    },
    deferredDeepLinkCallback: { route in          // Called with deferred deep link on first launch
        print("Deep link: \(route)")
    }
)
```

An `async` version is also available:

```swift
await SwaarmAnalytics.configureAsync(
    token: "your-token",
    host: "https://your-tracker-domain.com"
)
```

## Event Tracking

### Custom Events

```swift
SwaarmAnalytics.event()
SwaarmAnalytics.event(typeId: "registration")
SwaarmAnalytics.event(typeId: "level_up", aggregatedValue: 5.0, customValue: "warrior")
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `typeId` | `String?` | `nil` | Event type identifier |
| `aggregatedValue` | `Double` | `0.0` | Numeric value for aggregation |
| `customValue` | `String` | `""` | Arbitrary string payload |

### In-App Purchases

```swift
SwaarmAnalytics.purchase(
    typeId: "premium_subscription",
    revenue: 9.99,
    currency: "USD",
    receipt: "base64-receipt-or-transactionId"
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `typeId` | `String?` | `nil` | Purchase event type |
| `revenue` | `Double` | `0.0` | Revenue amount |
| `currency` | `String?` | `nil` | Currency code (e.g. `"USD"`) |
| `receipt` | `String?` | `nil` | App Store receipt or transaction ID for verification |

## Attribution

The SDK automatically fetches attribution data from the server after initialization using exponential backoff. Once valid data arrives (with a postback decision), the `attributionCallback` is invoked and fetching stops.

Attribution data is cached locally and available at any time:

```swift
if let attribution = SwaarmAnalytics.attributionData {
    print("Campaign: \(attribution.offer?.campaignName ?? "unknown")")
    print("Publisher: \(attribution.publisher?.name ?? "unknown")")
    print("Decision: \(attribution.decision?.rawValue ?? "pending")")
}
```

### Attribution Data Structure

```
AttributionData
├── offer: AttributionOffer?
│   ├── id, name, lpId
│   ├── campaignId, campaignName
│   ├── adGroupId, adGroupName
│   └── adId, adName
├── publisher: AttributionPublisher?
│   ├── id, name, subId, subSubId
│   ├── site, placement, creative
│   ├── app, appId
│   ├── unique1, unique2, unique3
│   └── groupId
├── ids: AttributionIds?
│   ├── installId, clickId, userId
├── decision: PostbackDecision?    // .passed or .failed
└── googleInstallReferrer: GoogleInstallReferrerData?
    ├── gclid, gbraid, gadSource, wbraid
```

## Apple Search Ads Attribution

On the first launch after install, the SDK automatically checks whether the install was attributed to an Apple Search Ads (Apple Ads) campaign. No configuration is needed.

If attributed, a UTM-formatted referrer string is attached to the first tracking event in the `installReferrer.referrer` field:

```
utm_source=appleads&utm_campaign=<campaignId>&utm_adgroup=<adGroupId>&utm_adid=<adId>&utm_keyword=<keywordId>
```

**Behavior notes:**

- Requires **iOS 14.3+** (silently skipped on older versions)
- Apple's API may return 404 for ~10s after install — the SDK retries up to 3 times automatically
- Only the **first event** carries the referrer; subsequent events do not
- If the install was not attributed to an Apple Ads campaign, the field is simply omitted
- If the user has disabled "Personalized Ads" in iOS Settings, Apple's API returns no useful data and the field is omitted

---

## Deferred Deep Links

On first app launch, the SDK checks for a deferred deep link from the server. If one exists, your callback is invoked with the route string:

```swift
SwaarmAnalytics.configure(
    token: "your-token",
    host: "https://your-tracker-domain.com",
    deferredDeepLinkCallback: { route in
        // Navigate to the deep link destination
        navigator.open(route)
    }
)
```

This only fires once (on the very first launch after install).

---

## IDFA & App Tracking Transparency

The SDK automatically reads the IDFA (Advertising Identifier) and includes it with events when available. On iOS 14.5+, you must request tracking permission via App Tracking Transparency before a non-zero IDFA is available.

Add `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` to your `Info.plist`, then request permission from a visible view:

```swift
import AppTrackingTransparency

ATTrackingManager.requestTrackingAuthorization { status in
    switch status {
    case .authorized:
        print("Tracking authorized")
    default:
        print("Tracking not authorized")
    }
}
```

See [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency) for details. The SDK works without IDFA — it simply won't be included in events.

---

## Tracking Control

```swift
SwaarmAnalytics.disableTracking()   // Pause event flushing and attribution
SwaarmAnalytics.enableTracking()    // Resume
```

---

## Automatic Behavior

The SDK handles the following automatically:

| Behavior | Details |
|---|---|
| **Install detection** | Sends an initial event on first launch |
| **Reinstall detection** | Uses keychain persistence (survives uninstall) to detect reinstalls and sends `__reinstall` |
| **Open tracking** | Sends `__open` event on every initialization |
| **Event batching** | Queues events and flushes in configurable batches |
| **Gzip compression** | All HTTP request bodies are gzip-compressed |
| **Attribution fetching** | Polls server with exponential backoff until attribution data arrives |
| **Deep link resolution** | Checks for deferred deep links on first launch |
| **Privacy manifest** | Bundled `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` for App Store compliance |
